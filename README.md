Tic Tac Toe - Console Game in Python
Features
Two-player mode: 'X' and 'O' take turns.

  Displays the current state of the board after every move.

  Checks for a winner after each move.

  Declares the winner and ends the game if a player wins.

ðŸ”§ How It Works
  The board is represented using two lists (xState and zState), each with 9 
  elements corresponding to the 9 positions.

  The function printBoard() displays the board with current moves.

  The function checkWin() evaluates all possible win conditions.

  The main loop alternates between the two players until a win condition is met.
